RepRap Firmware implementation - WIP

Project Goals:

	- Marlin G-Code compatible firmware with minimal build configuration
	  requirements
	  
	- Coding in Eclipse, using GNU-AVR toolchain (refer to
	  http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Eclipse for instructions on how to
	  configure)

Progress: Started. Eclipse configured, firmware defined and compiled

Abandoning Arduino integration in favour of a more explicit embedded device target Atmega1284P and dropping the learner interface
